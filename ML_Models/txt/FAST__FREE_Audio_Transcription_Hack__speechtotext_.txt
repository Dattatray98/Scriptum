Okay, speech to text cloud is my favorite like quick, simple, easy way to transcribe an audio file. So we'll just upload it here and let it do its thing. What I like so much about this is that it's web based. I don't have to run anything on my computer. I just upload it and go. Also, I can toggle the timestamps. And now I'm just copying this and I just send it into chat GBT, whatever I want to do with it. It's not the best. It's the quickest. It's the easiest. If you're looking for something that would be good for hour plus long videos that can also like separate the speakers. I have a video coming out on that so you can subscribe if you're interested in that. But this is great. This is easy, simple.
