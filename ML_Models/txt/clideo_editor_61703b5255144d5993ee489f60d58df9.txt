Hello, I am Jojewar Dhatatre, a second year computer engineering student at SKNCN Institute of Technology and Science Lona Vala. Today I am presenting my project Rescue AI, an AI powered system for disaster and fluid prediction that helps in sending timely alerts to communities at risk. So problem statement is, Flutes and heavy rainfall cause huge damage, life and property every year. Early warnings can save lives but traditional system of TANFoil fail to predict accurately or send alerts on time. So Rescue AI aims to solve this problem by providing real time predictions and alerts using AI. So how Rescue AI works? So Rescue AI collects data from rainfall, river levels and environmental factors. We trained machine learning model to predict fluid risk and river overflow. When the system detects high risk situation, it automatically sends SMS alerts to register users helping authorities and communities take timely action. So here is the demo of our project. So user signs up by clicking on this get started button. My internet is slow. So it is taking some time. So it is taking some time. Let's sign up with Google. Let's sign up with Google. So after sign up, we will redirect it to dashboard. So here is the rescue AI dashboard. Okay. Here is the rescue AI dashboard. Where remaining all the tasks are performed. So here we are on rescue AI dashboard. So here in this component, the daily weather is shown. And here in this component, the user location and the probability of fluid is shown. And this probability is provided by our ML model which is trained by us. And here the risk level is shown based on this probability. And here are the graphs of 7 days temperature. And this is the precipitation. And this one is wind speed graph which is for next 7 days. All these 3s. Let's test our platform and our ML. Then we click on this test with mock data. It sends the mock data to the ML. And it gives us a prediction value in percentage. We will see this value on the year. So here is. So the probability of fluid is 68.9%. Here is the alert is shown. So high fluid risk detected. So when user sees this alert, it is here. The user has option to view safety instructions. So when user clicks on this view safety instructions. It shows the next component or window. Where the safety instructions are provided. What a user needs to do when the risk is nearby him. And here is the safe places. Where the user can go. And rescue himself. So when user clicks on this places. It redirects to the map. To the map. And in this map. The user sees where. How to go. On that place. So basically it shows the route. To that place from user. So my internet is slow. So. It's taking time. So here. The user is here. And the place is here. So route is provided by this. And user can use satellite mode. To understand easily. And this places are. Higher. Higher ground level. Than user ground. Like user is. User ground level is from sea is. 657 meters. And this places are. More than that. So user can. Rescue himself. By. Going to this places. So. The demo ends here. And. That's it. So let's see. What we used in this project. So. Let's move towards. Your code. So. Let's first. View. The ML code. So. Let's. First. View. The ML code. So. Let's. First. View. The ML code. So. Let's. First. The ML code. So. In this. ML model. We used. Python. And. The libraries of. Python. Skitlearn. And. Pandas. NumPy. And. FastAPI. For. API routing. To create. We use. FastAPI. To create. API route. To provide. The ML service. To frontend. And. We used. The data. From. Is. Openly. Openly. Available. Like. We use. Open source. Data. And. Now. In. Our. Full stack. Like. Frontend. And. Backend. Project. We use. React. In. Frontend. And. TypeScript. And. We use. Clerk. As. Auth. Auth. Providers. Auth. Auth. Auth. Auth. Auth. Auth. Auth. accurate fluid risk prediction and sends automated alerts to reduce damage and protect lives so this is our github where we are provided all the code and instruction for our project and that's it thank you so much for watching my rescue project presentation thank you once again
