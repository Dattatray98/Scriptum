/n 1 /n 00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,982 Hello, I am Jojewar Dhatatre, a /n  /n 2 /n 00:00:02,982 --> 00:00:07,117 second year computer engineering student at /n  /n 3 /n 00:00:07,117 --> 00:00:08,560 SKNCN Institute /n  /n 4 /n 00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:11,480 of Technology and Science Lona Vala. /n  /n 5 /n 00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:14,145 Today I am presenting my project /n  /n 6 /n 00:00:14,145 --> 00:00:16,728 Rescue AI, an AI powered system /n  /n 7 /n 00:00:16,728 --> 00:00:18,560 for disaster and fluid /n  /n 8 /n 00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:22,426 prediction that helps in sending timely /n  /n 9 /n 00:00:22,426 --> 00:00:25,400 alerts to communities at risk. /n  /n 10 /n 00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:29,246 So problem statement is, Flutes and /n  /n 11 /n 00:00:29,246 --> 00:00:33,422 heavy rainfall cause huge damage, life /n  /n 12 /n 00:00:33,422 --> 00:00:35,400 and property every /n  /n 13 /n 00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:36,400 year. /n  /n 14 /n 00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:39,025 Early warnings can save lives but /n  /n 15 /n 00:00:39,025 --> 00:00:41,968 traditional system of TANFoil fail to /n  /n 16 /n 00:00:41,968 --> 00:00:43,400 predict accurately /n  /n 17 /n 00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:46,080 or send alerts on time. /n  /n 18 /n 00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,384 So Rescue AI aims to solve /n  /n 19 /n 00:00:48,384 --> 00:00:51,485 this problem by providing real time /n  /n 20 /n 00:00:51,485 --> 00:00:54,320 predictions and alerts using AI. /n  /n 21 /n 00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,240 So how Rescue AI works? /n  /n 22 /n 00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:01,704 So Rescue AI collects data from /n  /n 23 /n 00:01:01,704 --> 00:01:07,180 rainfall, river levels and environmental factors. /n  /n 24 /n 00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:09,788 We trained machine learning model to /n  /n 25 /n 00:01:09,788 --> 00:01:12,540 predict fluid risk and river overflow. /n  /n 26 /n 00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:15,458 When the system detects high risk /n  /n 27 /n 00:01:15,458 --> 00:01:19,348 situation, it automatically sends SMS alerts /n  /n 28 /n 00:01:19,348 --> 00:01:20,320 to register /n  /n 29 /n 00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:25,825 users helping authorities and communities take /n  /n 30 /n 00:01:25,825 --> 00:01:27,500 timely action. /n  /n 31 /n 00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:30,645 So here is the demo of /n  /n 32 /n 00:01:30,645 --> 00:01:32,360 our project. /n  /n 33 /n 00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:36,606 So user signs up by clicking /n  /n 34 /n 00:01:36,606 --> 00:01:40,700 on this get started button. /n  /n 35 /n 00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:41,700 My internet is slow. /n  /n 36 /n 00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:42,700 So it is taking some time. /n  /n 37 /n 00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:47,700 So it is taking some time. /n  /n 38 /n 00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:57,700 Let's sign up with Google. /n  /n 39 /n 00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:58,700 Let's sign up with Google. /n  /n 40 /n 00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:08,700 So after sign up, we will /n  /n 41 /n 00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:18,700 redirect it to dashboard. /n  /n 42 /n 00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:19,700 Okay. /n  /n 43 /n 00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:21,112 So here is the rescue AI /n  /n 44 /n 00:02:21,112 --> 00:02:21,700 dashboard. /n  /n 45 /n 00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:22,700 Okay. /n  /n 46 /n 00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:29,822 Here is the rescue AI dashboard /n  /n 47 /n 00:02:29,822 --> 00:02:37,403 where remaining all the tasks are /n  /n 48 /n 00:02:37,403 --> 00:02:39,700 performed. /n  /n 49 /n 00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:44,241 So here we are on rescue /n  /n 50 /n 00:02:44,241 --> 00:02:46,700 AI dashboard. /n  /n 51 /n 00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:51,228 So here in this component, the /n  /n 52 /n 00:02:51,228 --> 00:02:54,700 daily weather is shown. /n  /n 53 /n 00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:58,081 Here in this component, the user /n  /n 54 /n 00:02:58,081 --> 00:03:01,989 location and the probability of fluid /n  /n 55 /n 00:03:01,989 --> 00:03:02,940 is shown. /n  /n 56 /n 00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:06,519 And this probability is provided by /n  /n 57 /n 00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:09,586 our ML model, which is trained /n  /n 58 /n 00:03:09,586 --> 00:03:10,200 by us. /n  /n 59 /n 00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,441 And here the risk level is /n  /n 60 /n 00:03:12,441 --> 00:03:15,200 shown based on this probability. /n  /n 61 /n 00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:19,626 And here are the graphs of /n  /n 62 /n 00:03:19,626 --> 00:03:22,860 7 days temperature. /n  /n 63 /n 00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:25,440 And this is the precipitation. /n  /n 64 /n 00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,040 And this one is wind speed /n  /n 65 /n 00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:30,640 graph, which is for next 7 /n  /n 66 /n 00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,140 days. /n  /n 67 /n 00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:33,640 All these 3s. /n  /n 68 /n 00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:38,709 Let's test our platform and our /n  /n 69 /n 00:03:38,709 --> 00:03:39,200 ML. /n  /n 70 /n 00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,686 Then we click on this test /n  /n 71 /n 00:03:41,686 --> 00:03:43,120 with mock data. /n  /n 72 /n 00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,089 It sends the mock data to /n  /n 73 /n 00:03:45,089 --> 00:03:45,640 the ML. /n  /n 74 /n 00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:49,023 And it gives us a prediction /n  /n 75 /n 00:03:49,023 --> 00:03:51,440 value in percentage. /n  /n 76 /n 00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:55,116 We will see this value on /n  /n 77 /n 00:03:55,116 --> 00:03:56,440 the year. /n  /n 78 /n 00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:00,400 So here is. /n  /n 79 /n 00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:06,233 So the probability of fluid is /n  /n 80 /n 00:04:06,233 --> 00:04:07,400 68.9%. /n  /n 81 /n 00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:10,320 Here is the alert is shown. /n  /n 82 /n 00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,840 So high fluid risk detected. /n  /n 83 /n 00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,407 So when user sees this alert, /n  /n 84 /n 00:04:16,407 --> 00:04:17,760 it is here. /n  /n 85 /n 00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:20,460 The user has an option to /n  /n 86 /n 00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:23,160 view safety instructions. /n  /n 87 /n 00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,756 So when user clicks on this /n  /n 88 /n 00:04:25,756 --> 00:04:29,411 view safety instructions, it shows the /n  /n 89 /n 00:04:29,411 --> 00:04:32,680 next component or window where the /n  /n 90 /n 00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:35,600 safety instructions are provided. /n  /n 91 /n 00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,203 What we what a user needs /n  /n 92 /n 00:04:38,203 --> 00:04:40,494 to do when the risk is /n  /n 93 /n 00:04:40,494 --> 00:04:41,640 nearby him. /n  /n 94 /n 00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:45,034 And here is the safe places /n  /n 95 /n 00:04:45,034 --> 00:04:48,554 where user can go and rescue /n  /n 96 /n 00:04:48,554 --> 00:04:49,560 himself. /n  /n 97 /n 00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:54,136 So when user clicks on this /n  /n 98 /n 00:04:54,136 --> 00:04:59,560 places, it redirects to the map. /n  /n 99 /n 00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:02,068 And in this map, the user /n  /n 100 /n 00:05:02,068 --> 00:05:04,376 sees where how to go on /n  /n 101 /n 00:05:04,376 --> 00:05:05,480 that place. /n  /n 102 /n 00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:08,298 So basically it shows the route /n  /n 103 /n 00:05:08,298 --> 00:05:10,480 to that place from user. /n  /n 104 /n 00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,480 So my internet is slow. /n  /n 105 /n 00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:16,480 So it's taking time. /n  /n 106 /n 00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:19,569 So here the user is here /n  /n 107 /n 00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:22,400 and the place is here. /n  /n 108 /n 00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,400 So route is provided by this. /n  /n 109 /n 00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,400 And user can use satellite mode. /n  /n 110 /n 00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:31,400 To understand easily. /n  /n 111 /n 00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:31,480 This place is at a location. /n  /n 112 /n 00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,400 As possible, okay. /n  /n 113 /n 00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,300 Now, we actually saw how to /n  /n 114 /n 00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:33,400 go. /n  /n 115 /n 00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,400 So here we see. /n  /n 116 /n 00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,285 How to do you know this /n  /n 117 /n 00:05:35,285 --> 00:05:35,400 is? /n  /n 118 /n 00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:35,949 Basically, remember what option to want /n  /n 119 /n 00:05:35,949 --> 00:05:36,301 to do your vision at this /n  /n 120 /n 00:05:36,301 --> 00:05:36,400 moment. /n  /n 121 /n 00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,400 . /n  /n 122 /n 00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:37,773 Now, The main thing is that /n  /n 123 /n 00:05:37,773 --> 00:05:38,242 this user has had said essentially /n  /n 124 /n 00:05:38,242 --> 00:05:38,560 when you want us to היא /n  /n 125 /n 00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:47,200 and buy us to scheme, we're /n  /n 126 /n 00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,200 situations. /n  /n 127 /n 00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,527 Again, I have Ja月, you're already /n  /n 128 /n 00:05:49,527 --> 00:05:51,780 stampingiliation nuestras aintroính, that Meanwhile, the /n  /n 129 /n 00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:52,684 case, where every device starts pair /n  /n 130 /n 00:05:52,684 --> 00:05:52,860 is ног. /n  /n 131 /n 00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:53,593 It changes the давайте clap where /n  /n 132 /n 00:05:53,593 --> 00:05:53,860 you're home. /n  /n 133 /n 00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:54,527 This is lazy, but not only /n  /n 134 /n 00:05:54,527 --> 00:05:55,219 if you are doing some magic /n  /n 135 /n 00:05:55,219 --> 00:05:55,860 of the document required. /n  /n 136 /n 00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:56,860 However, cannot do it. /n  /n 137 /n 00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:00,404 the demo ends here and that's /n  /n 138 /n 00:06:00,404 --> 00:06:03,216 it so let's see what we /n  /n 139 /n 00:06:03,216 --> 00:06:06,760 used in this project so let's /n  /n 140 /n 00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:11,596 move towards your code so let's /n  /n 141 /n 00:06:11,596 --> 00:06:15,496 first view the ML code so /n  /n 142 /n 00:06:15,496 --> 00:06:18,460 in this ML model we /n  /n 143 /n 00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:22,155 used Python and the libraries of /n  /n 144 /n 00:06:22,155 --> 00:06:26,428 Python skitlearn and pandas numpy and /n  /n 145 /n 00:06:26,428 --> 00:06:29,200 fast API for API routing /n  /n 146 /n 00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:32,436 like to create we use fast /n  /n 147 /n 00:06:32,436 --> 00:06:35,671 API to create API route to /n  /n 148 /n 00:06:35,671 --> 00:06:39,653 provide the server ML service to /n  /n 149 /n 00:06:39,653 --> 00:06:41,520 frontend and we /n  /n 150 /n 00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:45,040 used the data from Kaggle which /n  /n 151 /n 00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:48,901 is openly openly available like we /n  /n 152 /n 00:06:48,901 --> 00:06:52,080 use open source data and now /n  /n 153 /n 00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,491 in our full stack like frontend /n  /n 154 /n 00:06:54,491 --> 00:06:57,058 and backend project we used react /n  /n 155 /n 00:06:57,058 --> 00:06:59,780 in frontend and typescript tailwind /n  /n 156 /n 00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:03,634 and exeos in backend we use /n  /n 157 /n 00:07:03,634 --> 00:07:09,487 node.js and express.js and typescript and /n  /n 158 /n 00:07:09,487 --> 00:07:11,200 we use clerk /n  /n 159 /n 00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:15,702 as a auth provider authentically for /n  /n 160 /n 00:07:15,702 --> 00:07:20,204 user authentication and we have used /n  /n 161 /n 00:07:20,204 --> 00:07:23,956 Google Maps API to show routes /n  /n 162 /n 00:07:23,956 --> 00:07:26,582 to user to go save go /n  /n 163 /n 00:07:26,582 --> 00:07:30,084 to save places and that's it /n  /n 164 /n 00:07:30,084 --> 00:07:32,960 this is our project and /n  /n 165 /n 00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,444 rescue is smart and practically a /n  /n 166 /n 00:07:35,444 --> 00:07:38,680 solution for natural disaster prediction it /n  /n 167 /n 00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,960 provides accurate /n  /n 168 /n 00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:43,980 fluid risk prediction and sends automated /n  /n 169 /n 00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:47,412 alerts to reduce damage and protect /n  /n 170 /n 00:07:47,412 --> 00:07:50,060 lives so this is our github /n  /n 171 /n 00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:52,930 system of the system where we /n  /n 172 /n 00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:55,800 are where we are provided all /n  /n 173 /n 00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,966 the code and instruction for our /n  /n 174 /n 00:07:58,966 --> 00:08:02,034 project and that's it thank you /n  /n 175 /n 00:08:02,034 --> 00:08:05,003 so much for watching my rescue /n  /n 176 /n 00:08:05,003 --> 00:08:09,060 project presentation thank you once again /n  /n 177 /n 00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:18,060 I'm /n  /n 178 /n 00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:20,060 I've been working good luck /n  /n 179 /n 00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:22,060 company /n
